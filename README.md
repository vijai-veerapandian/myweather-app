# MyWeather App

MyWeather App is a simple weather application built with React. It allows users to search for a city and view the current weather and a 7-day forecast.

## Features

- Search for a city to get current weather information
- View a 7-day weather forecast
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myweather-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd myweather-app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Building the App

To build the app for production to the `build` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
